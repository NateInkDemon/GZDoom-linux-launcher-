GZDoom for Linux

This script works on pretty much any Linux distro as long as you've got an internet connection. If you don't, you're fucked man wth

You must have GZDoom (or a similar engine) for this to work. If you're missing it, quit being a noob and grab it from the terminal:

Arch (btw):sudo pacman -S gzdoom
Fedora:sudo dnf install gzdoom
Ubuntu (or any Debian-based distro):sudo apt install gzdoom

If you aren't exactly a terminal wizard, the script can install you the engine so don't i got you
